'@waveso/docs': minor

A docs site is now four files and a folder of markdown. Search works out of the box, there is a real shell with a mobile drawer, and the public surface is frozen. Several changes are breaking; those come first.

**`docs.Layout` renders the whole shell**, as one line in your layout file:

```tsx
// app/docs/layout.tsx
import '@waveso/docs/styles.css';
import { docs } from '@/lib/docs';

export default docs.Layout;
```

Skip link, sticky header, sidebar column, mobile drawer and the grid that arranges them. It is a Server Component and your layout stays one — the two pieces that need a client carry their own boundaries inside the package — and it reads the navigation tree and the search index URL itself, so there is nothing to fetch and nothing to pass. It replaces four files every consumer used to write by hand, including a `'use client'` wrapper around `usePathname` that the README shipped as a recipe. Four props: `title`, `actions`, `search`, `children`.

**There is a mobile navigation drawer**, which there was not before: on a 390px viewport a reader could previously reach exactly one other page. It is one `<dialog closedby="any">` opened by a server-rendered `<button command="show-modal">`, so it works on the first tap — before hydration, and with JavaScript disabled. Focus moves inside and Tab stays there, Escape closes and restores focus, the backdrop dismisses it, and the page behind does not scroll; all of that is the browser's. At 64rem the same element becomes the sticky sidebar column via `display: contents`, so one navigation serves both breakpoints — one landmark, one copy of the links in the payload.

**`docs.Page` returns two children now**, the `<article>` and the table of contents, rather than one. They land as direct children of the grid, which is what puts them in separate columns. If you wrapped `docs.Page` in an element expecting a single child, that wrapper needs to go. A page with no headings emits no `<aside>` at all rather than an empty one, because the grid reserves that column with `:has()` and would otherwise give 15rem to nothing.

**Search is two files now, and neither is a build script.** The index is a prerendered route handler on the object you already hold, so it is rebuilt by the same `next build` that builds your pages — and in `next dev` it re-reads the disk per request, so a page you add is searchable on the next keystroke instead of at the next time you remember to run a script:

```ts
// app/docs/search-index.json/route.ts — the whole file
import { docs } from '@/lib/docs';

export const GET = docs.searchIndex;
export const dynamic = 'force-static';
```

`docs.searchIndexUrl` is derived from your `basePath`, so it is right at `/`, at `/docs`, and under a nested prefix. **`writeSearchIndex` is removed** — it was the only documented way to build an index, and this replaces it; `buildSearchIndex` and `renderAll()` remain for an artifact the route cannot express, and `docs.searchIndex` is asserted byte-identical to them. Verified against a real `next build`: the body prerenders in both output modes and is byte-identical between them, response headers survive into the prerender manifest, and CI now runs that build on every pull request.

**`export const dynamic = 'force-static'` is not optional, and the handler enforces it.** Without it Next re-renders your entire corpus per request, from markdown that output tracing did not put in the deployment bundle — on a serverless host that throws, at the reader, inside the search dialog, and the build prints no warning. It now fails loudly with `code: 'search-index-dynamic'`, naming the file to edit.

**`DocsSearch`, at `@waveso/docs/react/next-search`**, is the `'use client'` wrapper around `useRouter()` and `next/link` that every consumer was writing by hand — and skipping `Link` silently cost hover prefetching on every result. `SearchDialog` is unchanged and still host-agnostic.

**`SearchDialog`'s `searchOptions` prop is now `miniSearchOptions`**, and `createDocsRoute` takes the same name for the same object. MiniSearch's own name for the query defaults is `searchOptions`, so the old prop produced `searchOptions={{ searchOptions: { fuzzy: 0.1 } }}` — a stutter nobody writes, which is why both README examples were written flat, did not compile, and would not have errored at runtime either.

**Your project is no longer traced into your server bundle.** `contentDir` is a string this package cannot resolve statically, so Turbopack fell back to tracing the whole project — every source file, your entire `public/` folder, your last build's output — into the server output for every docs route. Measured at 332 traced files for a three-page site, of which 39 were the project's own. Nothing here reads markdown at request time, so nothing needs tracing, and now nothing is.

**Five names are gone**, all pre-1.0 and all replaced: the `./react/*` wildcard is enumerated as explicit subpaths, and `./markdown-links` and `./search-options` are no longer exported. Every subpath in `exports` is now listed in the README, and that is enforced by a test.

**The default page is worth looking at.** A 46rem measure and a system font stack, a 1.2 minor-third type scale, tables that scroll instead of shredding the layout, one focus `outline` in place of five `box-shadow` rings (which also deletes the forced-colors block that existed to patch them), and a responsive shell with breakpoints at 64/80/100rem. The element tree, the five layout tokens and the breakpoints are frozen in `docs/adr/001-shell-contract.md`.

**Three new harnesses, because the old ones could not see these failures.** A browser tier running real Chromium — jsdom reports every width as `0`, so the measure, the type scale, reflow and the table floor were unassertable. A smoke build of a real Next application against the published `exports` map, in both output modes. And `pnpm check:readme`, which type-checks every example in this README as one project: it immediately found `app/docs/layout.tsx` defined twice with different bodies, and an `imageResolver` example calling `imageSize(path)` when `image-size` v2 takes a `Uint8Array`.
